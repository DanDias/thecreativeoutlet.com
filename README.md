## Goals
My goal for this site is to make a portfolio site for myself and everything I do; which is...
* Pixel Art
* Writing
* Coding
* Games
* Dumb Jokes Made Real, like this new site idea!

## Design
Well, the pixel art thing led down a rabbit hole of how I probably don't want to do Animated Sprites on a website the way they are in a game engine because the layouts are a little more fiddily. I could just start this whole repo over, but what fun is that? We learn from mistakes. Mistakes are valid. Mistakes should exist. And you should persist!

SOOO, My next idea I feel like is more cohesive and more my actual style. A fake store! And get a template that's readily available for design simplification! Not going crazy here, not doing any CMS type stuff... yet. (Help, someone make me stop creeping on scopes...)

Header: Welcome to The Creative Outlet!
Subheader: "With deals so good you'll say, "I don't buy it"". 

Each "product page" is a separate project. I do so damn many, I can fill up a site with them easily. Categories would be types of projects; see above list for inital.

Customer support will possibly lead to argubot for Ken. Either way, the contact information would be for my Amazon Connect number. I can record a fun hold thing. Maybe put some fun loops in there. "If you like endless phone trees. Press 3." If I get real crazy make a lambda that outputs random "departments". Get a little inspiration from Nathan.
